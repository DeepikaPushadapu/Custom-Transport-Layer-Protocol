# Custom-Transport-Layer-Protocol
This project implements KTP (Kharagpur Transport Protocol), a custom transport layer protocol built over UDP to provide reliable, in-order, and efficient communication. While UDP is lightweight and fast, it lacks reliability. KTP bridges this gap by introducing mechanisms for packet ordering, retransmission, and synchronization
